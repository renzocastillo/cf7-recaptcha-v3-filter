Note: This plugin works with Contact Form 7. Make sure you have Contact Form 7 installed.

1. Upload the plugin folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ screen in WordPress
3. By default, plugin will automatically load reCAPTCHA script only on every page where [contact-form-7] shortcode exists so there's nothing else to do.
If you are using a custom shortcode or visual builder ( Divi, Elementor) to load your contact form 7 forms, then follow step 4.
4. Go to 'Contact Form 7' menu and select 'reCAPTCHA Filter Settings' plugin. 
5. Put the name of the custom shortcode at the text box and save settings. Now this plugin will be loading reCAPTCHA script only where that shotcode exists.
